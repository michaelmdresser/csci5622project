# CSCI5622 Machine Learning: Kickstarter Project

## Overview

<b>Contributers:</b> Curry Buscher, Michael Dresser, Erika Hunhoff, Garrison Linn

<b>Summary</b>: This project takes a set of data from Kaggle about Kickstarter projects during 2018 and attempts to build models to predict the success of those projects. We apply feature engineering and feature extraction to build 3 datasets from the initial one, each differing slightly. We then tune and train multiple models for the dataset and evaluate their performance against each other and others' prediction work on this dataset.

## Repo Contents

We did our work using Jupyter Notebooks. This repo includes the following contents:

* [Curry_Figs](Curry_Figs) -- Figures generated for the final report and the poster made by Curry
* [Figures](Figures) -- Figures generated for the final report and the poster made by Erika, Michael, and Garrison
* [knn-predictions](knn-predictions), [svm-predictions](svm-predictions), [nn-final-models](nn-final-models) contain the final results for KNN, SVM, and Neural Nets (created by Erika and Michael)
* preprocess-* notebooks: Notebooks containing methods of preprocessing the data.

The rest of the notebooks deal with data processing/modifications and actual application and design of the various machine learning algorithms we explored.
